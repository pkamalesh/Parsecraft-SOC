Word Embedding is a language modeling technique for mapping words to vectors of real numbers. It represents words or phrases in vector space with several dimensions. Word embeddings can be generated using various methods like neural networks, co-occurrence matrices, probabilistic models, etc. Word2Vec consists of models for generating word embedding. These models are shallow two-layer neural networks having one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer.

Word2Vec is a widely used method in natural language processing (NLP) that allows words to be represented as vectors in a continuous vector space. Word2Vec is an effort to map words to high-dimensional vectors to capture the semantic relationships between words, developed by researchers at Google. Words with similar meanings should have similar vector representations, according to the main principle of Word2Vec. Word2Vec utilizes two architectures:

CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words): The CBOW model predicts the current word given context words within a specific window. The input layer contains the context words and the output layer contains the current word. The hidden layer contains the dimensions we want to represent the current word present at the output layer. 

Skip Gram : Skip gram predicts the surrounding context words within specific window given current word. The input layer contains the current word and the output layer contains the context words. The hidden layer contains the number of dimensions in which we want to represent current word present at the input layer.
